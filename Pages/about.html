    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      After logging in, users land on a main page with options to access the
      menu or log off. Selecting the menu button takes users to a genre
      selection page where they can choose from various music genres. Once a
      genre is selected, a curated list of songs for that genre is displayed.
      Users can either explore more genres or provide feedback using the comment
      section. The logoff option remains available at all stages for easy
      navigation back to the login page.
